# Hello-Rust

> literally a repository of me learning rust

## Overview

It is to my belief that three languages can do everything: Python for anything data or science related, Javascript for anything app or backend related, & Rust for anything low-level or IoT related. With mastery of these 3 languages, it should be possible to do anything within the field of computer science. With Python, one can engineer data, train models & create fancy visualizations to evaluate them. With Rust, one can write highly optimized code for loading & running these models. And with the power of asynchronous Javascript, one can create efficient APIs for these models, or wrap the entire thing into an app via Electron.js.

I am a fairly good programmer, in the sense I can quickly jump languages. This is because with experience, one can extract syntax patterns easily from examples of the new language, relate it to their own internal model of what a programming language has, and "compile" it to the new language. But different languages have different specialties and syntactic sugar to go along with it, which takes actually playing with the language to grasp & learn. I have already gotten a feel for the full extent of Python & Javascript, but aside from having touched C++ a bit long ago, I have little experience in low-level languages, let alone Rust. As such, it is imperative I learn Rust, to complete the infinity guantlet of programming languages.

This repository will probably contain, commit by commit, what happens while I am following the Rust handbook. Enjoy.
